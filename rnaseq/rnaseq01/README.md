## Patient Presentation: Mr. Alistair Humphrey

**Presenting Complaint:** Mr. Alistair Humphrey, a 68-year-old male, presents to the neurology clinic with progressive motor weakness, cognitive decline, and unexplained hearing loss.

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Humphrey reports experiencing subtle changes in his gait over the past year. He initially attributed it to aging, but the weakness has progressed to involve both arms and legs, making activities like buttoning his shirt and climbing stairs increasingly difficult. Concurrently, his wife has noticed memory lapses, difficulty with problem-solving, and changes in personality, characterized by increased irritability and social withdrawal. Three months ago, he started experiencing a noticeable decline in his hearing, making conversations challenging, especially in crowded environments. This sensory loss is not accompanied by tinnitus or vertigo.

**Past Medical History:** Mr. Humphrey has a history of well-controlled hypertension, managed with medication. He denies any history of head trauma, stroke, seizures, or exposure to neurotoxins. He had a heart attack 10 years ago, but has fully recovered and actively participates in cardiac rehabilitation.

**Family History:** Mr. Humphrey reports a complex family history. His father developed a similar progressive weakness starting in his early 70s, eventually requiring full-time care. His mother had progressive cognitive decline in her 80s, diagnosed as late-onset dementia of unknown type. A younger sister developed sudden onset sensorineural hearing loss in her early 50s, and a maternal uncle exhibited unusual skin thickening and blistering, particularly in sun-exposed areas, in his 60s.

**Social History:** Mr. Humphrey is a retired accountant. He enjoys reading, gardening, and spending time with his grandchildren. He is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol socially.

**Physical Examination:**

*   **Neurological Exam:** The neurological examination reveals upper motor neuron signs, including increased tone in the arms and legs, hyperreflexia, and clonus. There is mild muscle atrophy in the distal extremities. His gait is wide-based and unsteady. He exhibits difficulties with fine motor skills, such as finger tapping and rapid alternating movements. Cognitive testing reveals deficits in short-term memory, executive function, and visuospatial processing.
*   **Audiological Exam:** Audiometry confirms bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, primarily affecting high frequencies. There are no signs of middle ear pathology.
*   **Dermatological Exam:** The skin examination reveals areas of mild thickening and dryness, particularly on the hands and feet. There are no active lesions, blistering, or significant inflammation.

**Diagnostic Investigations:**

*   **MRI Brain:** MRI of the brain reveals mild cerebral atrophy, particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes. There are no signs of vascular lesions, tumors, or other structural abnormalities.
*   **Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS):** EMG and NCS show evidence of motor neuron dysfunction, consistent with a progressive motor neuron disease.
*   **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis:** CSF analysis is normal, ruling out infectious or inflammatory etiologies.
*   **Genetic Testing:** A comprehensive genetic panel is ordered due to the complex family history and overlapping neurological, dermatological, and audiological findings. Preliminary analysis reveals significant variations in gene expression patterns within central nervous system tissue and skin biopsies, specifically affecting pathways associated with protein degradation, cellular stress response, signal transduction, barrier function, and intracellular transport. These alterations are suggestive of an underlying genetic factor affecting multiple organ systems.
**Provisional Diagnosis:** The constellation of symptoms – progressive motor weakness, cognitive decline, sensorineural hearing loss, subtle dermatological changes, and a concerning family history – raises suspicion for a rare, inherited neurodegenerative disorder with pleiotropic effects. The abnormal gene expression patterns warrant further investigation to identify the causative genetic defect and to determine potential therapeutic interventions. Further testing will be done to assess skin integrity and barrier function. The patient’s symptoms could be caused by a disorder related to cellular homeostasis and signal processing, especially affecting neural and sensory tissues.
