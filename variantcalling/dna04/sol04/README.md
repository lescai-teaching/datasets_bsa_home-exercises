**Patient Presentation: Eleanor Vance**

**Age:** 7 years old

**Chief Complaint:** Global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and behavioral challenges.

**History of Presenting Illness:** Eleanor's parents report concerns about her development since infancy. She was late to reach motor milestones, sitting unsupported at 10 months and walking independently at 18 months. Her language development has been significantly delayed; she spoke her first words around 2 years old and currently uses short phrases but has limited expressive vocabulary. Eleanor attends a specialized developmental preschool but struggles with learning concepts and following instructions. Her adaptive skills, such as dressing and feeding herself, are also delayed compared to her peers. In addition to developmental delays, Eleanor exhibits behavioral difficulties, including impulsivity, hyperactivity, and occasional aggressive outbursts when frustrated. Her attention span is short, and she has difficulty staying focused on tasks. She also displays repetitive behaviors, such as hand-flapping, especially when excited or anxious.

**Family History:** Eleanor is the first child of healthy, non-consanguineous parents. The mother is 32 years old, and the father is 35 years old. There is no family history of intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, or other neurodevelopmental disorders reported in either side of the family. The mother had an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery.

**Physical Examination:** Eleanor's physical examination is generally unremarkable. Her height and weight are within the normal range for her age. She has subtle facial features that include a slightly broad forehead and mild midface hypoplasia, but no major dysmorphic features are noted. Neurological examination reveals normal muscle tone and reflexes. However, gross and fine motor coordination are slightly impaired.

**Developmental Assessment:** Formal developmental testing reveals a global developmental delay, with significant deficits in cognitive, language, and adaptive skills. Her cognitive abilities are estimated to be in the moderate to severe range of intellectual disability. Standardized assessments indicate significant communication delays and difficulties with social interaction.

**Behavioral Observations:** Eleanor exhibits features suggestive of neurodevelopmental condition. She demonstrates impaired social reciprocity, challenges with communication (both verbal and non-verbal) and has presence of restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.

**Diagnostic Investigations:**

*   **Karyotype:** Normal female karyotype (46,XX).
*   **Fragile X DNA testing:** Negative.
*   **Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA):** No clinically significant copy number variants detected.
*   **EEG:** Normal, without evidence of epileptiform activity.
*   **Metabolic screening:** Normal, ruling out common metabolic disorders associated with developmental delay.
*   **Whole Exome Sequencing (WES):** Initiated to investigate for possible underlying genetic cause.

**Provisional Diagnosis:** Global developmental delay and intellectual disability of unknown etiology, with possible neurodevelopmental disorder. The combination of cognitive deficits, language delays, behavioral challenges, and subtle facial features, in the absence of common chromosomal abnormalities or fragile X syndrome, suggests a possible single-gene disorder affecting neurodevelopment. Further genetic testing (WES) is pending to identify the underlying cause and guide management strategies.

**Management Plan:** Eleanor is currently receiving early intervention services, including speech therapy, occupational therapy, and behavioral therapy. Her parents are being provided with support and education regarding her condition and available resources. Regular monitoring of her development and behavior is ongoing. The results of WES will be crucial for providing a more definitive diagnosis, guiding prognosis, and informing genetic counseling for the family regarding recurrence risk in future pregnancies.
